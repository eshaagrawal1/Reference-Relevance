**Overview :**
The research paper analytical tool is a tool that helps researchers to analyze their research papers. This tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to extract relevant information from the text of research papers. This tool can be used to identify key concepts, topics, and themes within a research paper, as well as to highlight important findings, methodologies, and references. It can also be used to compare and contrast multiple research papers on the same topic, and to identify gaps in the existing literature.
The proposed method provides researchers with a quantitative measure of the relationship between the citation and the full-text article. This can help improve the citation analysis process by providing more accurate and relevant information.
By combining PDF extraction, API-based abstract retrieval, and similarity metrics, the proposed methodology aims to provide a quantitative measure of the relevance between the citation and the paper. The approach has the potential to improve the effectiveness of literature reviews and enable researchers to more efficiently identify and evaluate relevant literature. Furthermore, the methodology can help identify gaps in the existing literature, which can be particularly useful in rapidly evolving fields. By doing so, researchers can better understand the current state of research and develop new research questions that address the limitations of the existing literature. Overall, the proposed methodology has the potential to improve the quality and impact of scientific research by enabling researchers to identify relevant and important literature more efficiently and effectively.
